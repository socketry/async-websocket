[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/socketry/async-websocket.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/socketry/async-websocket)
[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/socketry/async-websocket.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/socketry/async-websocket)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/socketry/async-websocket/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/socketry/async-websocket)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

	gem 'async-websocket'

And then execute:

	$ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

	$ gem install async-websocket

## Usage

There are [examples](examples/) which include:

- [A command line chat client/server](examples/chat) which can read input from `stdin` and send messages to the server.
- [A small MUD client/server](examples/mud) which uses JSON for communation between client/server.
- [A utopia-based web application](examples/utopia) which uses a JavaScript client to connect to a web application server.

### Client Side with Async

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require 'async'
require 'async/io/stream'
require 'async/http/url_endpoint'
require 'async/websocket/client'

USER = ARGV.pop || "anonymous"
URL = ARGV.pop || "http://localhost:7070"

Async do |task|
  stdin = Async::IO::Stream.new(
          Async::IO::Generic.new($stdin)
  )
	
  endpoint = Async::HTTP::URLEndpoint.parse(URL)
	
  Async::WebSocket::Client.open(endpoint) do |connection|
    input_task = task.async do
      while line = stdin.read_until("\n")
        connection.write({user: USER, text: line})
	connection.flush
      end
    end
		
    connection.write({
      user: USER,
      status: "connected",
    })
		
    while message = connection.read
      puts message.inspect
    end
  ensure
    input_task&.stop
  end
end
```

### Server Side with Rack & Falcon

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env -S falcon serve --bind http://localhost:7070 --count 1 -c

require 'async/websocket/server/rack'
require 'set'

$connections = Set.new

run lambda {|env|
  Async::WebSocket::Server::Rack.open(env, protocols: ['ws']) do |connection|
    $connections << connection
		
    while message = connection.read
      $connections.each do |connection|
        connection.write(message)
	connection.flush
      end
    end
  ensure
    $connections.delete(connection)
  end or [200, {}, ["Hello World"]]
}
```
